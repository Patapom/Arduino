Check "State Diagram.png" for an overview of the chip's on-board state diagram.

Initialization:
	[1] Turn Frequency Synthesizer on
	(2 opt) Calibrate the Frequency Synthesizer

TX / RX Modes Switching:
	• Send "STX" command ==► Switch to "Transmit Mode"
	• Send "SRX" command ==► Switch to "Receive Mode"

Stop (back to IDLE state):
	• Happens on buffer underflow in TX FIFO Mode (i.e. no more data to transmit, buffer is empty so back to sleep)
	• Happens on buffer overflow in RX FIFO Mode (i.e. too many received data, buffer is full so back to sleep)


SPI:
____

• Transfers are done MSB first!
• CSn must be set to LOW during transfers on the SPI bus
	=► When CSn is pulled LOW, MCU must wait for SO to go LOW before transmitting (indicates crystal is running).
		(unless in sleep or XOFF mode, the SO goes LOW immediately)
• CSn must be set to HIGH after a data burst transfer to notify of the end of the burst.

• Max CLK frequency
	► for "Single Access" mode:
		• 10 MHz if a 100ns delay is inserted between address and data bytes
		•  9 MHz if no delay
	► for "Burst Access" mode:
		• 10 MHz if a 100ns delay is inserted between address and data bytes
		•  6.5 MHz if no delay

• Timings
	• Clock Low [50 -] ns
	• Clock High [50 -] ns
	• CSn goes LOW to first bit => 20ns in ACTIVE mode (150ns from POWER DOWN mode)
	• CSn goes HIGH after last bit => 20ns
	• Tsd = Time Setup Data (applies between address/data and data/data bytes)
		► min 55ns in "Single Access" mode
		► min 76ns in "Burst Access" mode

• Transactions

	WRITE
	► starts with a HEADER BYTE that contains:
		[7] R/W_ bit
		[6] Burst access bit
		[5-0] 6-address bits (A5-A0)

	► After <Tsd> delay (see above) we can send the DATA BYTE:
		[7-0] Dw7 to Dw0 (data write)

	READ
	► We receive a STATUS BYTE that is sent on the SO pin each time a header byte or data byte is transmitted on the SI pin.
	 It contains:
		[7] CHIP_RDYn bit. HIGH until power and crystal have stabilized. Should be LOW to use SPI!
		[6-4] STATE[2:0] A 3-bits states that indicates the current main state machine mode:
			000 IDLE
			001 RX mode
			010 TX mode
			011 FSTXON (Fast TX mode ready)
			100 CALIBRATE (Frequency Synthesizer calibration is running)
			101 SETTLING (Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is settling)
			110 RXFIFO_OVERFLOW (RX FIFO has overflowed. Read out any useful data, then flush the FIFO with SFRX)
			111 TXFIFO_UNDERFLOW (TX FIFO has underflowed. Acknowledge with SFTX)

		[3-0] FIFO_BYTES_AVAILABLE[3:0] Indicates the number of bytes available in the RX FIFO or free bytes in the TX FIFO (When FIFO_BYTES_AVAILABLE=15, 15 or more bytes are available/free)

	► After <Tsd> delay (see above) we can read the DATA BYTE:
		[7-0] Dr7 to Dr0 (data read)


Register Access:
________________
► The configuration registers on the CC1101 are located on SPI addresses from 0x00 to 0x2E.
► Registers with consecutive addresses can be accessed in an efficient way by setting the burst bit (B) in the header byte.
	The address bits (A5 – A0) set the start address in an internal address counter that is incremented by one each new byte (every 8 clock pulses).
	The burst access is either a read or a write access and must be terminated by setting CSn high.
► For register addresses in the range 0x30-0x3D (i.e. COMMAND STROBE), the burst bit is used to select between status registers when burst bit is one, and between command strobes when burst bit is zero.
	Because of this, burst access is not available for status registers and they must be accessed one at a time. The status registers can only be read.

FIFO Access:
____________
The 64-byte TX FIFO and the 64-byte RX FIFO are accessed through the 0x3F address.
When the R/W¯ bit is zero, the TX FIFO is accessed, and the RX FIFO is accessed when the R/W¯ bit is one.

• Single Byte Access
	Expects a header byte with the burst bit set to zero and one data byte.
	After the data byte, a new header byte is expected; hence, CSn can remain low.
• "Burst Access"
	Expects one header byte and then consecutive data bytes until terminating the access by setting CSn high.


PATABLE Access:
_______________
The 0x3E address is used to access the PATABLE, which is used for selecting Power Amplifier (PA) power control settings.
The SPI expects up to eight data bytes after receiving the address.

By programming the PATABLE, controlled PA power ramp-up and ramp-down can be achieved, as well as ASK modulation shaping for reduced bandwidth.


Bitrate / Bandwidth Config:
___________________________

Data rate setup using DRATE_M (mantissa) and DRATE_E (exponent):
	R_data = ((256 + DRATE_M) * 2^(DRATE_E)) / 2^28 * F_osc

One can retrieve:
	DRATE_E = floor( log2( R_data * 2^20 / F_osc )
	DRATE_M = R_data * 2^28 / (F_osc * 2^DRATE_E) - 256		(round DRATE_E up if DRATE_M ends up being 256)

Receiver channel bandwidth
	BW_channel = F_osc / (8*(4+CHANBW_M)*2^CHANBW_E)


Synch Config:
_____________
• Bit Synch algorithm extracts the clock from the incoming symbols.
 The algorithm requires that the expected data rate is programmed as described above.

• Byte Synch is achieved by a continuous sync word search.
 The sync word is a 16 bit configurable field (can be repeated to get a 32 bit) that is automatically inserted at the start of the packet by the modulator in transmit mode.


Packet Mode:
____________
The CC1101 has built-in hardware support for packet oriented radio protocols.
This can be enabled on packet reception:
	• Preamble detection
	• Sync word detection
	• CRC computation and CRC check
	• One byte address check
	• Packet length check (length byte checked against a programmable maximum length)
	• De-whitening
	• De-interleaving and decoding

See <Packet Format.png> for a description of the packets.

Filtering:
	► Packets can have an "address" header used for filtering so various devices can have multiple addresses and packets quickly addressed to each of them, packets with the wrong address are simply dropped and listening continues.
	► CRC filtering can be used to discard (i.e. flush) packets that failed the CRC test.


Modulation Formats:
___________________
• CC1101 supports amplitude, frequency, and phase shift modulation formats.
• Optionally, the data stream can be "Manchester coded" by the modulator and decoded by the demodulator (basically 0's are encoded by descending fronts while 1's are encoded by ascending fronts).
	Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_code
	Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_TLLACZuRk (various encoding methods)

► Phase-shift keying https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying
► Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation
► Non-Return to Zero Encoding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-return-to-zero (basically, 1 is +V, 0 is -V)


Signal Qualifiers and Link Quality:
___________________________________
Several tools exist:
	• Sync Word Qualifier
	• Preamble Quality Threshold
	• RSSI
	• Carrier Sense
	• Clear Channel Assessment
	• Link Quality Indicator


Starting Up:
____________
• When the power supply is turned on, the system must be reset.
	This is achieved by one of the two sequences described below, i.e. automatic power-on reset (POR) or manual reset.
• After the automatic power-on reset or manual reset, it is also recommended to change the signal that is output on the GDO0 pin.
	The default setting is to output a clock signal with a frequency of CLK_XOSC/192.
	However, to optimize performance in TX and RX, an alternative GDO setting from the settings found in Table 41 on page 62 should be selected.

► Power-On Reset (POR)
A power-on reset circuit is included in the CC1101
Minimum requirements are:
	Parameter				Min	Typ	Max Unit	Condition/Note
	Power-up ramp-up time	-	-	5	ms		From 0V until reaching 1.8V
	Power off time			1	-	-	ms		Minimum time between power-on and power-off

The internal powerup sequence is completed when CHIP_RDYn goes low.
CHIP_RDYn is observed on the SO pin after CSn is pulled low.

► Manual Reset
The other global reset possibility on CC1101 uses the SRES command strobe. By issuing this strobe, all internal registers and states are set to the default, IDLE state.
The manual power-up sequence is as follows (see Figure 27):
	• Set SCLK = 1 and SI = 0, to avoid potential problems with pin control mode (see Section 11.3).
	• Strobe CSn low / high.
	• Hold CSn low and then high for at least 40 μs relative to pulling CSn low
	• Pull CSn low and wait for SO to go low (CHIP_RDYn).
	• Issue the SRES strobe on the SI line.
	• When SO goes low again, reset is complete and the chip is in the IDLE state.

Wake On Radio (WOR):
____________________
The optional Wake on Radio (WOR) functionality enables CC1101 to periodically wake up from SLEEP and listen for incoming packets without MCU interaction.
When the SWOR strobe command is sent on the SPI interface, the CC1101 will go to the SLEEP state when CSn is released.
NOTE: The RC oscillator must be enabled before the SWOR strobe can be used, as it is the clock source for the WOR timer.


General Purpose / Test Output Control Pins:
___________________________________________
The three digital output pins GDO0, GDO1, and GDO2 are general control pins configured with IOCFG0.GDO0_CFG, IOCFG1.GDO1_CFG, and IOCFG2.GDO2_CFG respectively.
• GDO1 is the same pin as the SO pin on the SPI interface, thus the output programmed on this pin will only be valid when CSn is high.
	The default value for GDO1 is 3-stated which is useful when the SPI interface is shared with other devices.
• The default value for GDO0 is a 135-141 kHz clock output (XOSC frequency divided by 192).
	Since the XOSC is turned on at poweron-reset, this can be used to clock the MCU in systems with only one crystal.

	***************
	NOTE: Can we use this to "DEBUG" the input line with an oscilloscope???
	Like maybe the input signal is "downsampled" at 1/192 from the 26MHz frequency down to 136 KHz "slowed down" version???

	Check modes in GDOx_CFG:
		12 (0x0C) Serial Synchronous Data Output. Used for synchronous serial mode.
		13 (0x0D) Serial Data Output. Used for asynchronous serial mode.

	OR use asynchronous mode that looks like it's feeding RAW data to the GDOx pins:
	§27.1 « In asynchronous serial mode no data decision is done on-chip and the raw data is put on the data output line in RX.
			When using asynchronous serial mode make sure the interfacing MCU does proper oversampling and that it can handle the jitter on the data output line.
			The MCU should tolerate a jitter of ±1/8 of a bit period as the data stream is timediscrete using 8 samples per bit. »

	***************
