# Connections

* Input voltage should be 12V DC - 1A
* Green connectors are left and right outputs
* Stereo input by jack connector
* Jumper "CON1" is the power ON switch
* Jumper "CON3" is, I belive, some kind of "mute" button (useful to power down the amplifier without scratches or heavy noises I suppose)
